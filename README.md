# memory-game
Hi! Welcome to my memory-game, I hope you enjoy playing!

When you start the game, a modal will appear in which you must enter your name 
(or select it if you have already played) and place the number of cards you want 
to play with (keep in mind that it is an even number).

After entering this data, the game will start üòÅ you will see a series of cards 
and you will have 5 seconds to memorize their positions since then they will 
turn over and you will have to remember or guess where they were located! On 
the board you will be able to see how many hits you have had and when you failed.

Soooo let's get started!
